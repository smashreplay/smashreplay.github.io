| **WSC Sports** | $50M+ (est.) | $155M | Unclear (growth stage) |
| **Magnifi** | N/A | Acquired by Minute Media | N/A (rolled into parent) |
| **Hooper.gg** | N/A | Not disclosed | Unlikely (early stage) |
| **Fullcourt.ai** | N/A | $1M | Unlikely (pre-revenue/early) |
| **Eklipse.gg** | N/A | No backing | Unclear (freemium/bootstrapped) |

| **Hudl** | Dominant in scholastic sports, 3.5M customers, full coaching platform |
| **Hooper.gg** | Auto-generated basketball stats + highlights from phone video, 92% accuracy |
| **Fullcourt.ai** | Youth sports focus, affordable family/team plans, multi-sport |
| **Eklipse** | Gaming-to-sports crossover, audio-based detection, TikTok-native output |

## Opportunities for Smash Replay

Based on this landscape, potential differentiators for Smash Replay:

1. **No app install required** — Browser-based (unlike Hooper, Fullcourt, Athlete AI which are native apps). This is a significant friction reducer.
2. **Free / no account** — Most competitors require sign-up and/or payment. A free, instant-use web tool has a lower barrier.
3. **Privacy-first** — Client-side processing (if applicable) means video never leaves the user's device, unlike cloud-based competitors.
4. **Underserved segments** — Rec league players, casual fans making personal mixtapes, and social media creators who want quick highlights without committing to a subscription.
5. **Desktop support** — Most competitors are mobile-first/only. Having a desktop version is useful for coaches reviewing game film.

### Gaps in the Market
- **No dominant free, browser-based tool exists** for basketball highlight detection
- **Most B2C apps require subscriptions** ($5–$100/month) for core features
- **Enterprise tools** (WSC Sports, Magnifi) are inaccessible to individuals
- **General video editors** (CapCut, Descript) lack sport-specific intelligence
- **Youth sports parents** are underserved by affordable, easy-to-use tools
